Welcome to the GitHub account of **WGG Robotics**, the student robotics team of **Willibald-Gluck-Gymnasium Neumarkt (Germany)**.

We design, build and program our own mobile robots and compete in the **RoboCup Rescue / Rapidly Manufactured Robot Challenge (RMRC)** and other robotics events.

For full documentation, please visit our  **[WGG Robotics Documentation Wiki](https://github.com/wggRobotic/team-docs/wiki).**

## Who we are

- **Team name:** WGG Robotics  
- **School:** Willibald-Gluck-Gymnasium Neumarkt, Bavaria, Germany  
- **Focus:** Rescue robotics, autonomous navigation, rovers, quadrupeds & crawlers  
- **Members:** motivated students from different grades  
- **Mentors:** teachers and external partners supporting hardware, software & project work


We mainly work in our school’s **Makerspace**, using 3D printers, electronics and CAD/simulation tools to prototype and improve our robots.

# Our Robots

#### Everything we work on is available to the public

As a team, we want to be as transparent as possible, so we have decided to make all our components and programmes available as open source. All important information and notes on hardware and software are stored on this Github. 

## N10 - Our rover

___


N10 is a rover like robot based on a rocker bogie design. The 6 Wheels can turn perpendicular to the ground. The 3-segment robotic arm lays ontop on the rover in its resting position. There, the camera mounted to its gripper can function as a rear camera while driving. The main / front camera is fixed to the first segment.

N10 was our robot in the RoboCup World Championship 2024 in Eindhoven in the RMRC league (Rapidly Manufactured Robot Challenge). This was the first real competition for our newly founded team.

The first version was designed and built in under two months, which led to several challenges along the way and multiple problems in the actual competition. Our previous TDM (Team Description Material) for Eindhoven and the original design are available via the following links:

+ [TDM](https://github.com/wggRobotic/N10-Robot)
+ [Hardware - Robot Design and Components](https://github.com/wggRobotic/CAD-Files-and-Components-N10)


The lessons we learned in Eindhoven were incorporated into our new rover design. We developed a completely new modular main body. While the rocker-bogie suspension remains largely the same, the adjustments to the models and a different 3D-printing method have significantly improved the durability of the parts. Additionally, both the robotic arm and gripper feature a new design.

## Idefix - Our robodog

**For more Information** click here [Idefix](https://github.com/wggRobotic/Idefix-profile)
___

Together with Antonello and Raffael, the wggRobotics team had long wanted to build a robotic dog. This year (2024/2025), we finally made it happen! 

Our insperiation came from [Spot](https://bostondynamics.com/products/spot/) by Boston Dynamics and the open-source project [SpotMicro](https://spotmicroai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).  After initial tests during Consumenta 2024 in Nuremberg, we decided to redesign the dog and use different servo motors.

And now, here is our Idefix!

## NoName - Our SLAM-Teststation

Our test robot, "noname," serves as a platform for evaluating various additional modules, including LIDAR, AI cameras, and depth perception sensors. The ultimate goal of this project is to develop an autonomous navigation system capable of real-time environmental mapping and decision-making.

![noname](../assets/noname.png)

### Core Components

To achieve these objectives, "noname" is equipped with state-of-the-art hardware:

- OAK-1-Lite W Camera – An AI-powered vision system for object detection and recognition.

- Intel RealSense D435 – A depth camera providing precise 3D perception.

- Slamtec RPLIDAR C1 – A high-precision LIDAR sensor for mapping and obstacle detection.

- Siemens IPC127E – A robust industrial PC handling data processing and computational tasks.

### Project Goals

The primary focus of "noname" is to test and integrate these technologies for efficient autonomous navigation. By leveraging sensor fusion and advanced algorithms, the robot will be able to generate accurate maps of its environment and navigate without human intervention.

With further development, "noname" will contribute to research in autonomous robotics and intelligent mobility solutions.
