Welcome to the GitHub account of **WGG Robotics**, the student robotics team of **Willibald-Gluck-Gymnasium Neumarkt (Germany)**.

We design, build and program our own mobile robots and compete in the **RoboCup Rescue / Rapidly Manufactured Robot Challenge (RMRC)** and other robotics events.

For full documentation, please visit our  **[WGG Robotics Documentation Wiki](https://github.com/wggRobotic/team-docs/wiki).**

## Who we are

- **Team name:** WGG Robotics  
- **School:** Willibald-Gluck-Gymnasium Neumarkt, Bavaria, Germany  
- **Focus:** Rescue robotics, autonomous navigation, rovers, quadrupeds & crawlers  
- **Members:** motivated students from different grades  
- **Mentors:** teachers and external partners supporting hardware, software & project work


We mainly work in our school’s **Makerspace**, using 3D printers, electronics and CAD/simulation tools to prototype and improve our robots.

# Our Robots

We currently work on several robots and test platforms:

- **N10 – RMRC Rover**  
  Mars-style rover for the RoboCup RMRC league with rocker-bogie suspension and modular body.

- **Idefix – Quadruped Robo Dog**  
  A four-legged robot dog inspired by Spot and SpotMicro, fully redesigned with new servos and mechanics.

- **“noname” – SLAM Test Platform**  
  Mobile base for testing sensors like LIDAR, depth cameras and AI vision for autonomous navigation.

- **QUAC - Crawler**

- **Further platforms**  
  We also experiment with additional robots and demo platforms in cooperation with universities and partners.

## NoName - Our SLAM-Teststation

Our test robot, "noname," serves as a platform for evaluating various additional modules, including LIDAR, AI cameras, and depth perception sensors. The ultimate goal of this project is to develop an autonomous navigation system capable of real-time environmental mapping and decision-making.

### Core Components

To achieve these objectives, "noname" is equipped with state-of-the-art hardware:

- OAK-1-Lite W Camera – An AI-powered vision system for object detection and recognition.

- Intel RealSense D435 – A depth camera providing precise 3D perception.

- Slamtec RPLIDAR C1 – A high-precision LIDAR sensor for mapping and obstacle detection.

- Siemens IPC127E – A robust industrial PC handling data processing and computational tasks.

### Project Goals

The primary focus of "noname" is to test and integrate these technologies for efficient autonomous navigation. By leveraging sensor fusion and advanced algorithms, the robot will be able to generate accurate maps of its environment and navigate without human intervention.

With further development, "noname" will contribute to research in autonomous robotics and intelligent mobility solutions.
