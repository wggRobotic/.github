**Mentors:**

- **Mr. Tobias Wagner**: 
He is the team mentor, and he helps with delivering or ordering the needed parts for our robot. He also gives good advice and tips on how to assemble the robot. Additionally, our mentor also gives us directions when needed.

- **Antonello Pastore**:
- **Raffael Pöggel**:

**Members:**
- **Jonas Nicklas**:
He is our main programmer and does most of the software work . He also helps the other team members with explaining and teaching them how to code.

- **Florian Schäff**:
He focuses on making the 3D design of the chassis of our robot He also helps Florian and Luca with building the robot.

- **Tamina Gruber**:
She mostly works on the mechanical aspect of our robo dog. Currently she is focusing on the paws.

- **Luca Zylla**:
Luca is mostly working on the hardware in our rover, but he always lends a helping hand where it is needed.

- **Dalea Badri**:
Dalea focused on taking care of the logistics and organizes the TDP. She also in charge of our social media accounts.

- **Fiona Schäff**:
Fiona’s emphasis is on the logistics as well and she handles the TDP together with Dalea too. If help is needed with the hardware, she lends a helping hand. She overlooking the whole team.

- **Lino Odenbach**:
Lino’s job is to work on the hardware with Florian Schäff and constructing the rover.

- **Christopher Zech**:
Since he is quite talented and interested in math and programming, he focused on all informatics and mathematical aspects as well as programming and the software. He works closely together with Friedrich, Jonas and Daniel

- **Friedrich Worch**:
Friedrich is also one of our programmers, so he helps the others with the software and spend his time on developing the code for our robot. 

- **Caja Wetzler**:
Caja is interested in CAD-Design. Together with Dalea, she is in charge of social media and contacts sponsors.

- **Anton Mackh**:
Anton is a problemsolver. He can design CAD-Models and is working on the robotic arm for our rover.

- **Daniel Schmid**:
Daniel is also one of our programmers, so he helps the others with the software and espically for our rover.

- **Leon Eckstein**:
Friedrich is also one of our programmers, so he helps the others with the software and spend his time on developing the code for our robot.

- **Sophia Riemann**:
Sophia is relativly new in this team, but she and Tobias are working on the arm and gripper for our rover.

- **Tobias Hackl**:
Tobias is relativly new in this team, but he and Sophia are working on the arm and gripper for our rover.


We work as a team on all our robotic projects. At this time we have four projectes at different states of progression.

## Our rover - N10

As a team, we want to be as transparent as possible and have decided to make all our components and programmes available as open source. All important information and notes on hardware and software are stored on this Github. Here is a small overview of the links to the most important repositories. These will be updated and supplemented with further information.

Our rover N10 did take part in the RoboCup World Championship 2024 in Eindhoven in the RMRC-league (Rapidly Manufactured Robot Challenge). This was the first real competition for our newly founded team. The rover - model was desigend and build in under two months, so we encounterd some difficulties. Our old TDM (Team Discription Material) and the old the design can be found in the following links:

+ [TDM](https://github.com/wggRobotic/N10-Robot)
+ [Hardware - Robot Design and Components](https://github.com/wggRobotic/CAD-Files-and-Components-N10)


The lessons we learned in Eindhoven were incorparteted into our new rover-design. We have a completly new desigend modular main body. The rocker-bogie-suspension is mostly the same, but some tweaks in the models and a diffrent 3D-printing method made the parts much more durable. The robotic arm and gripper have also a new design.

All components, a list of the parts etc. can be found here: [N10_v.4.0](https://github.com/wggRobotic/CAD-Files-N10_version_4_0)

# Some impressions from last year:
**N-10 is alive**
